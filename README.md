# ArangoDB River Plugin for ElasticSearch

This is an ElasticSearch plugin that will connect to your ArangoDB server, read the Write-Ahead-Log of a collection and update an ElasticSearch index with the data.

# Installation

The zip file contains all necessary dependencies and nothing else is needed to install it in ElasticSearch.

## Install from URL

```
/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin \
    --install arangodb \
    --url https://github.com/arangodb/elasticsearch-river-arangodb/releases/download/v1.0.1/elasticsearch-river-arangodb-1.0.1.zip
```

## install from file (after manual download)

```
/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin \
    --install arangodb \
    --url file:///${HOME}/Downloads/elasticsearch-river-arangodb-1.0.1.zip
```

## Manual install

To install manually, unzip the archive into the ES plugins directory see: 'paths.plugin' config value of ES. The file structure should look like this:

```
$ cd <ES plugins directory>
$ find . -type f
./arangodb/elasticsearch-river-arangodb-1.0.1.jar
./arangodb/... more jars (dependencies of the plugin) ...
```

## Remove Plugin

Removing the plugin is required for upgrades.

```
/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin --remove arangodb
```

# Start & Configuration

To create the river, run a curl statement from a shell:

```
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_river/arangodb/_meta' -d '{
    "type": "arangodb",
    "arangodb": {
        "db": "<DATABASE_NAME>",
        "collection": "<COLLECTION>",
    },
    "index": {
        "name": "<ES_INDEX_NAME>",
        "type": "<ES_TYPE_NAME>"
    }
}'
```

Example:

```
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_river/arangodb_test_car/_meta' -d '{
    "type": "arangodb",
    "arangodb": {
        "db": "test",
        "collection": "car"
    },
    "index": {
        "name": "cars",
        "type": "car"
    }
}'
```

Here is a more complex configuration with user credentials and a simple javascript example:

```
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_river/arangodb_test_car2/_meta' -d '{
    "type": "arangodb",
    "arangodb": {
        "host": "carhost",
        "port": carport,
        "db": "test",
        "collection": "car",
        "credentials": {
            "username": "riveruser",
            "password": "rivauser"
        },
        "reader_min_sleep": "100ms",
        "reader_max_sleep": "10s",
        "script" : "ctx.doc.title = ctx.doc.manufacturer + \" \" + ctx.doc.model;"
    },
    "index": {
        "name": "cars",
        "type": "car",
        "bulk_size": 5000,
        "bulk_timeout": "500ms"
    }
}'
```

# Scripting

To use scripting to filter or manipulate documents before they are indexed, you must install the ElasticSearch scripting plugin. Please refer to the [ElasticSearch Plugins](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-plugins.html) documentation. Specifically, the scripting plugins.

# Tips & Tricks

## ArangoDB Authentication

To add a user for basic authentication, open an ArangoDB shell and run the following command:

```
require("org/arangodb/users").save("<username>", "<password>");
```

This will create a user with the given user name and the given password.
Currently, ArangoDB just provides user authentication, but no authorization on a collection or operation level.

When starting the database, you can set the ArangoDB daemon parameter

```
--server.disable-authentication true
```

if you like to run the database without any authentication mechanism.

## Filtering

Use scripting if you want to filter your data. Let's say your documents have a boolean field named "available".
The following script will filter your data due to their availability flags:

```
"script" : "if ( ctx.doc.available == false ) { ctx.operation = 'SKIP' };"
```

This script checks the "available" flag, and it changes the operation to "SKIP" for the given document context. This document will not be indexed. Please note that, if the document is already indexed, this will mean it won't be updated or deleted.

# TODO

* extend integration test:
  * stop river, make a change in arangodb, must not be reflected in ES anymore
  * start river again, should pick up where we stopped *or* start 'now' which means we've lost the last update

# Development & Contributing

If you want to change and test something, the basic development process is simple:

* fork and clone repo, checkout devel branch
* create your own branch from devel
* eclipse users run `gradle cleanEclipse eclipse`
* make your changes
* run the integration tests (requires ArangoDB and ElasticSearch to be installed) with `gradle clean test intTest`
* build a distribution with `gradle clean dist` (see directory `build/distributions`)
* test your custom build in your environment
* if happy commit and push, then create a pull request against the devel branch
